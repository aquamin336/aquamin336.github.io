### CPSC 120

*Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was a favorite because It was very cool to make a functional blackjack scoring system. I was able to write functions that calculated the correct value of a Blackjack and would then add them up. It was also a fun process creating all the different values for each card and matching them with their number counterparts.

*Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was another of my favorites because it was a very interesting process to be able to write a file. It was also the first time that I used the input and output for creating the file. It was also very interesting to use the getline function as it was able to read the file.

*Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was another of my favorites because it was a very challenging one for me. Getting all of the colors to create the constant loop that the gif would function with was tough. It was still cool to see the end result of the gif actually working as it had very cool colors to it.
